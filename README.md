# Monte_Carlo_Simulations

Integrating - Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion , Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process , Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model, Heston model ,Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho,
Mertonâ€™s Jump Diffusion model, Stochastic Volatility Plus Jumps (SVJ) model and variance gamma (VG) model. 

Method: Discretisizing using Euler Scheme and then integrating. In some cases FFT( as it is faster)  was also used. 


Finally VAR was calculated using Monter Carlo Method.
